<h1>Playing Sounds</h1>

<p>
Once one or more AudioBuffers are <a href="loading-sounds.html">loaded</a>  then we're ready to play sounds.

Let's assume we've just loaded an AudioBuffer with the <a href="loading-sounds.html#dogBarking">sound of a dog barking</a> and
that the loading has finished.
</p>

<p>
Then we can play this <em>dogBarkingBuffer</em> with a the following code.
</p>

<pre>
var context = new webkitAudioContext();

function playSound() {
    var source = context.createBufferSource();  // creates a sound source
    source.buffer = dogBarkingBuffer;           // tell the source which sound to play
    source.connect(context.destination);        // connect the source to the context's destination (the speakers)
    source.noteOn(0);                           // play the source now
}

</pre>

<p>
This playSound() function could be called every time somebody presses a key or clicks something with the mouse.
</p>

<p>
Even better, we could make the function take the <em>buffer</em> and <em>time</em> as arguments:
</p>

<pre>
var context = new webkitAudioContext();

function playSound(buffer, time) {
    var source = context.createBufferSource();
    source.buffer = buffer;
    source.connect(context.destination);
    source.noteOn(time);
}

</pre>

<p>
Then a different sound could be played depending on different events (like which key is pressed).  Normally, a time of 0 would be used
to "play sound now".  But, sounds can be played at exact times to <a href="playing-rhythms.html">create rhythms</a>.
